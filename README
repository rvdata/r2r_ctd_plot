Web app to display Seabird Scientific data for CTD
---------------------

Dependencies: mojolicious.org
To install Mojolicious as sudo or as root:
As per mojolicious.org: 
	sudo curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - -M https://cpan.metacpan.org -n Mojolicious


```
$ sudo cpan
$ cpan
$ install Mojolicious

```

Modules required:
cpan Array::Utils
cpan Class::Struct

Note: The app uses these libraries but they are shipped with the source code:
1. https://plotly.com/javascript 
2. https://fabianlindfors.se/multijs/

To run as a background process:
nohup ./ctdplot.pl daemon -l http://<ip_addr>:<port> &
Example:
nohup ./ctdplot.pl daemon -l http://192.168.1.110:8080 &

Note even though it says it's a daemon, it isn't. 
So need to run as a background process with nohup.

The default dir is /home/data/ctd/

But this can be given with the -d option:
nohup ./ctdplot.pl -d <ctd_dir> daemon -l http://<ip_addr>:<port> &

IMPORTANT: the dir where the processed CTD data is needs to end with a backslash, for example:
nohup ./ctdplot.pl -d /home/my_data/ctd/ daemon -l http://192.168.1.110:8080 &
