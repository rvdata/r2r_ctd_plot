Web app to display Seabird Scientific data.
Dependencies: mojolicious.org
To install Mojolicious:
1. As per mojolicious.org: curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - -M https://cpan.metacpan.org -n Mojolicious
2. Should also be able to "sudo apt install mojolicious"

Note: The app uses these libraries but they are shipped with the source code:
1. https://plotly.com/javascript 
2. https://fabianlindfors.se/multijs/

to run as a background process:
nohup ./ctdplot.pl daemon -l http://<ip_addr>:<port> &
Example:
nohup ./ctdplot.pl daemon -l http://192.168.1.110:8080 &

Note even though it says it's a daemon, it isn't. 
So need to run as a background process with nohup.

The default dir is /home/data/armstrong/ctd/
But this can be given with the -d option:
nohup ./ctdplot.pl -d <ctd_dir> daemon -l http://<ip_addr>:<port> &
Note: the dir needs to end with a backslash, for example:
nohup ./ctdplot.pl -d /home/my_data/ctd/ daemon -l http://192.168.1.110:8080 &
